                        | Apart from being a software developer, I am a fitness enthusiast and was active in various college marathons. I enjoy traveling and play guitar as a creative hobby, having performed multiple times in company fun and chill meetings for audiences of 100+. I enjoy watching and playing football and was active in college football and basketball leagues. I was responsible for the event category called Proshow in college fest 2019, which was a sold-out show. I anchored various events in college fests as well as hosted multiple events in my company. I like to read fiction and non-fiction during my free time.
